# Step 1 - The menu loop

# Welcome the user
# Ask the user which action they want to do [list|add|delete|quit]
# get the user answer and store it in a variable (string)
# Direct the user to the right action
# Display a TODO message 
# loop until the user types "quit"

# Step 2 - Listing the gift

# Iterate over the hash (.each_with_index)
# format the text
#  1 - [ ] sockets
#  2 - [X] ruby book
#  3 - [ ] macbook pro


# Step 3 - Adding an item

# Ask the user which gift to add
# Store the answer
# Add the gift to the gift list (CRUD create: hash_name[new_key] = new_value)
# Tell the user the gift was added

# Step 4 - Delete

# Display the items
# Ask the user what they want to delete (number/index)
# index = get the user answer (integer)
# find the gift (key) somehow... (.keys)
# Delete the gift from the hash (CRUD delete hash.delete(key))
# Tell the user the gift was deleted

# Step 5 - Mark a gift as purchased

# Display the gift_list
# Ask the user what they want to delete (number/index)
# index = get the user answer (integer)
# find the gift (key) somehow... (.keys)
# Change the value of the selected gift (CRUD Update hash_name[key] = new_value)
# tell the user the gift was updated

# STEP 6 - Import from Etsy

# Make sure that your scraper works (with local file)
# Ask the user for a keyword 
# Store the keyword
# Scrape the html for 5 gifts
# Turn the scraper into a method
# The scrape method should return a HASH with 5 gifts
# Display the gifts hash (reuse display_list)
# Ask the user which number gift do they want to add to gift list
# Get the keys from the esty hash
# find the gift using the index
# Add the gift from etsy to the gift_list
# Tell the user that the gift was imported
